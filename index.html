<h1>Why HODL crypto?</h1>
<br>
<p> In case you didn't know: HODL means hold</p>
<p>When investing in highly volatile assets the most important aspect that determines your success is not how much you invest but your sanity.</p> <p>The reason for this is simply. If you lose it the constant ups and downs are eventually going to wear you out and you'll sell in order to gain some calm.</p> <p>Many of the people who got rich investing in crypto did it when it was a joke. Because of that they bought small amounts and never really checked price changes until they had gained massive gains.</p> <p>This is the reason why hodl has become so popular in the crypto community.</p> <p>The good thing about crypto and hodl is that you don't need insane amounts of capital to make a good return.</p> <p>However with great potential for gains also comes great potential for losses. Managing your psychology for that reason is the most important aspect in order to gain massively. Not the amount of $ invested.</p> <p>Of course eventually your gains are going to be proportional to how much you invested but think about this way:</p> <p>if you buy 50$ worth of crypto and forget about for years you're more likely to make huge gains than if you bought 5000$ and checked the price changes over and over.</p> <p>In the second scenario you'll be much more sensitive to price changes. You'll be driven by fear and greed.</p> <p>In a highly volatile environment the worst you can do is let fear and short-term greed dictate your actions.</p> <p>You need a plan that will allow you to achieve whatever monetary goal is.</p> <p>Owners of public stocks have what is called selling schedules. Basically they in advance agree to sell either x amount of stock at a specific time in the future. Or the agree to sell x amount of stock when the price reaches y.</p> <p>Our strategy works similarly.</p> <p>Instead of being obsessed with price changes in the short term, we want to maximize your long term potential. This doesn't mean you won't ever sell. You will sell a % of your remaining coins the first time the cryptocurrency of your choice reaches a certain threshold.</p> <p>Notice that I said the first time. Since price changes all the time and sometimes it lingers in a certain rage selling every time it reaches a certain threshold is going to exclude from potentially selling at much higher tops.</p> <p>The idea is that by selling the first time it reaches that top you'll avoid the fear of missing out. You're not going to worry whether that was the highest top because you already sold some amount at that top.</p> <p>You're also going to avoid fear of missing out if the crypto goes even higher because you won't sell the majority of your crypto at any top.</p> <p>In the calculator we assume the price of the crypto will first very quickly grow exponentially and then it will start to slow down. x being the initial price. 10x, 100x, 1000x, 10,000x then 50,000x , 100,000x, 150,000x and finally 200,000x.</p> <p>Of course the more gains you want to have the longer you time horizon has to be. The first 100x may happen in a matter of weeks whereas it may take years for the price to increase 10-fold again. It also becomes harder to sustain higher prices so the growth will naturally stifle down over time.</p> <p>This is why is important to get early. Like yesterday. You're more likely to succeed if you invest a very small amount (an amount that is pocket change for you) early and leave it alone than to invest thousands of dollars and be obsessed about the price changes every day/ every week.</p> <p>You are your worst enemy. Managing your psychology is the most important thing so again invest a really small amount. It must feel like a joke to you. This is how people who got rich first with crypto thought. They bought some pocket change of crypto and forget it existed until somebody told them the price had changed dramatically.</p>
