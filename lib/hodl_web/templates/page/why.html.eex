<h2>Why hodl?</h2> <p>hodl means hold.</p> <p>When investing in highly volatile assets the most important aspect that determines your success is not how much you invest but your sanity.</p> <p>The reason for this is simply. If you lose it the constant ups and downs are eventually going to wear you out and you'll sell in order to gain some calm.</p> <p>Many folks who got rich investing in crypto did it when it was a joke. Because of that they bought small amounts and never really checked price changes until they had massive gains.</p> <p>This is the reason why hodling has become so popular in the crypto community.</p> <h2>The Strategy</h2> <p>The good thing about crypto and hodl is that you don't need insane amounts of capital to make a good return.</p> <p>However with great potential for gains also comes great potential for losses. Managing your psychology for that reason is the most important aspect in order to gain massively. <strong>Not</strong> the amount of $ invested.</p> <p>Of course eventually, your gains are going to be proportional to how much you invested but think about this way:</p> <p>if you buy 50$ worth of crypto and forget about for years you're more likely to make huge gains than if you bought 5000$ and checked the price changes over and over.</p> <p>In the second scenario, you'll be much more sensitive to price changes. You'll be driven by fear and greed.</p> <p>In a highly volatile environment, the worst you can do is let fear and greed dictate your actions.</p> <p>You need a plan that will allow you to achieve whatever monetary goal is.</p> <p>CEOs and others working in managing of public companies have what is called selling schedules. Basically they in advance agree to sell either <em>x</em> amount of stock at a specific time in the future. Or they <em>agree to sell x amount of stock when the price reaches y.</em></p> <p>Our strategy works like the second strategy.</p> <p>Instead of being obsessed with price changes in the short term, we want to maximize your long term potential. This doesn't mean you won't ever sell. You will sell a percentage of your remaining coins the first time the cryptocurrency of your choice reaches a certain threshold.</p> <p>Notice that I said the first time. Since price changes all the time and sometimes it lingers in a certain rage selling every time it reaches a certain threshold is going to exclude from potentially selling at much higher tops.</p> <p>The idea is that by selling the first time it reaches that top you'll avoid the fear of missing out. You're not going to worry whether that was the highest top because you already sold some amount at that top.</p> <p>You're also going to avoid the fear of missing out if the crypto goes even higher because you won't sell the majority of your crypto at any top.</p> <p>In the calculator we assume the price of the crypto will first very quickly grow exponentially and then it will start to slow down. x being the initial price. 10x, 100x, 1000x, 10,000x then 50,000x. You can of course modify it according to your own predictions and expectations.</p> <p>The higher the gains you want the longer you time horizon has to be. The first 100x may happen in a matter of weeks or months whereas it may take years for the price to increase 10-fold again.</p> <p>This is why is important to get early. Like yesterday. You're <strong>more likely to succeed</strong> if you invest a very small amount (an amount that is pocket change for you) early and leave it alone than to invest thousands of dollars and be obsessed about the price changes every day/ every week.</p> <h2>Our solution</h2> <p>How to hodl allows you to hold easily by sending you timely alerts to your email.</p> <ul> <li>When to sell: We will let you know according to your own plan, when is the right time to sell.</li> <li>When to buy: You can use our system to know when to '<em>buy the dips</em>', that way you save money in your investment by getting more crypto for your money when the market is down.</li> </ul> <p>Using our system will help you grow your investments <strong>and</strong> as an investor.</p> <p>Ready to start? <a href="howtohodl.org/new-hodl">Create a hodl schedule</a></p>
